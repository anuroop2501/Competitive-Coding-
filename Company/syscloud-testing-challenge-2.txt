James has decided to take a break from his work. He makes a plan to visit India for a few days with his family. He knows a lot about India, and also about the various cities he could visit. He decides to write down all the cities on a paper. Let the number of cities be n. Now, he shows the list to his wife and asks her, the city/cities she wants to visit. He tells her that she can select any city/cities and any number of cities. The wife says, she needs a day to decide.

After this, James calls his son and tells him all about the trip, and the list of cities. He gives him a task and asks him, the number of ways the city/cities can be chosen from the list, if the total number of cities written on the list is n. The cities are numbered from 1 to n. At least 1 city has to be selected.
